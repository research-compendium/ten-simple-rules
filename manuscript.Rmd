title: "Ten simple rules for publishing a research compendium"
---

[Inspiration](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=ten%20simple%20rules%20for)

- add all data and code created by you
- follow language guidelines for packaging (ref "R and friends" paper)
- understand copyright and licensing for data, code, and text (ref Stodden paper)
- add a single entry point for the computations (Makefile, main.sh, run.R, but ideally a literate programming file)
- write instructions for different levels ("explain to me like I'm five")
- get a colleague to review it (fallback: follow your own instructions on a different computer/VM, ..)
- describe computational environment (fallback: text, better: executable instructions like Dockerfile, Vagrantfile
- export snapshot of computational environment
- publish the whole compendium in a repository (own discretion, do not blindingly publish parts independently, concrete software version and used data only, do not embed software and data paper)
- tag the compendium (and see if it is disoverable via https://research-compendium.science)
- curate meaningful links and metadata (cf. zenodo metadata)
